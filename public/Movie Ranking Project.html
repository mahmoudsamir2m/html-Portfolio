     good work. Make sure you are not only an older teen,
     but a mature teen as well. Watch the family version.
     Watch the family version. This takes most of the language out of the way. 
     The movie is great, and I can't wait to see the next installments!
     There is a hugging and kissing scene... references to mating... but it's pretty mild.
     The Na'vi are scantily clad... I didn't notice anything explicit.
     However, if that's a turn-off for someone, don't watch this movie.
     I recommend it for older teens>

<h3>spider-Men</h3>
<p>
Throughout two decades of web-slinging,
rebooting, reversals of fortune,
immersions into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and sporadic reappearances by the Spidey-hating J.
Jonah Jameson, the “Spider-Man” film franchise has been wildly inconsistent, yet remarkably indestructible.
“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” the latest episode,
a follow-up to the Oscar-winning animated feature “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (2018),
likely will delight many long-time Spidey fans with its mythos-expanding plotting, 
quicksilver universe shuffling, abundant Easter Eggs, wide-ranging inclusivity,
and audaciously variegated visuals — even if it totally confuses, if not actively annoys,
 newbies unfamiliar with the minutiae of what someone here aptly refers to as “the canon.”

<h3>Aquaman</h3>
<p>
    It was a bumpy ride but, at long last,
     we finally have James Wan’s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) may have taken his place as King of Atlantis,
    but the lingering threat of Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) means he must team up with estranged brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to protect the seven seas. 
    Sounds like a great setup for another hilarious Thor: Ragnarok-esque sibling team-up, right?
